2014-04-02 Seung Yi

 * Imageapp is buggy; problem with displaying the latest image
 * Tried to fix it but could not find where this is coming from
 * Tried copying and pasting other students' imageapp to see if
   the problem still remains.
 * Looks like the problem does not go away even after I copy and paste
   someone's entire imageapp.
 * Metadata to pictures to add image name and description
 * Search by the name or description
 * HW10 is... not... done... got an exam tomorrow for another class

 * Projects done(so far 30pts): 
 3. Swipe a template from oswd.org and put it in place on your imageapp server. (5 pts; browser_app)
 4. Change imageapp to support JPEG and TIFF. (5 pts; app_feature)
 5. Add a URL that provides a list of images, resized to thumbnails. (5 pts; app_feature)
 6. Add image "metadata" uploading, storage, and retrieval: image name, description, etc. (5 pts; app_feature)
 7. Add image metadata search (find image by ...) (5 pts.; app_feature) (BROKEN, GOTTA FIX IT)
 23. Write a URL handler so that each image is referred to by its number, e.g. /image_raw/10; make it so that going to the latest image in your imageapp redirects to the right image number. (5 pts; app_feature)
